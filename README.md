# Planning
Pi in the Sky! We're there! We are going to try to re-create the [house from _Up_](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39UQE3j4S8A/maxresdefault.jpg) (you know the one). We will, as requested, collect accelerometer data, and will attempt to cause the "house" to descend (by releasing one, two, however many balloons we need) and then collect it. We're probably going to include a camera to chronicle our journey. The equations we'll need to determine the price of our components are here.

(number of balloons) = 81.7 * (mass in kilograms)

(ft<sup>3</sup> of helium) = 33 * (mass in kilograms)
## The Build
The house will look, ideally, similar to the "_Up_ house", with some minor changes, like access inside to retrieve the data and some way for the camera to look around.
## The Stuff Inside
We'll need a Pi, an accelerometer, a camera, and some method of retreiving the data. Currently, we're thinking of ideas like having a way to simply pull out the SD card from the Pi, though based on the needs of securing the balloons, we might make the roof removable or something. The weight will be concentrated in such a way that the CM is directly below the chimney. We'll also need some way of releasing some balloons, which will probably include an altimeter and a servo.
## The Tentative Schedule
We will begin the project the week before the beginning of the second semester, January 13<sup>th</sup>.

For the first 3 weeks, we will work on the code.
* We'll spend the first week working on the accelerometer and servo
* The second week will be the altimeter
* The third week will add the camera (maybe) and fix all the bugs

For the next 2 weeks, we will create the housing for the components.
* One week will be spent working on the area surrounding the chimney and components like the servo
* The next week will be spent adding the other components and adjusting the CM

For the 2 weeks after that, we will create the house exterior.
* These weeks will both be spent in pursuit of this goal

For the next week, we will construct the project and bug-fix.
* This includes re-making and re-assembling any broken/badly designed parts

For the last week, we will finish fixing the bugs and send the project up.
* This includes the final CM evaluations

We'll theoretically finish on March 13<sup>th</sup>.
