# Planning
Pi in the Sky! We're there! We are going to try to re-create the [house from _Up_](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39UQE3j4S8A/maxresdefault.jpg) (you know the one). We will, as requested, collect accelerometer data, and will attempt to cause the "house" to descend (by releasing one, two, however many balloons we need) and then collect it. We might also try to do something else, but 

(number of balloons) = 81.7 * (mass in kilograms)

(ft^3 of helium) = 33 * (mass in kilograms)
